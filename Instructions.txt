## **HOW TO USE (General Overview)**

1. **Create a New Project**
   Start by creating a new folder and selecting it—this will be your project folder. Each project is stored in its own folder.

2. **Capture Frames**
   Click **"Capture Frame"** to take a picture and add it to the timeline. You can click on individual frames to review them. To return to the live camera view, click **"Back to Live Feed."**

3. **Duplicate Frames**
   Select a frame in the timeline, then click **"Duplicate"**. This creates a copy of the selected frame, placed immediately after it.

4. **Delete Frames**
   To delete a frame, select it and click **"Delete."** Deletion isn't permanent until you close the app or open a different project.

5. **Undo/Redo**
   Undo and redo are currently limited to deleting frames. If you delete something by mistake, use **"Undo"** to bring it back, or **"Redo"** to delete it again.

6. **Export Your Animation**
   Export your timeline as a **GIF** or **MP4**. If **"Loop"** is checked, the exported GIF will loop continuously; if unchecked, it will play only once.

7. **Rescan for Cameras**
   Use the **"Rescan"** button to search your system for available cameras.

8. **Themes**
   You can switch between different UI themes. If you choose **"Custom Theme,"** click **"Edit Custom Theme"** to adjust settings. Theme preferences are saved per project.
